# Anki Morph Frequency
Small tool to grab all morphemes from a deck to a list to allow them to be extracted to a priority file using (AnkiMorphs)[https://github.com/mortii/anki-morphs], which can then be sorted using frequencies from frequency dictionaries.
Inspired by the (JP-resources)[https://github.com/MarvNC/JP-Resources/tree/main] repository for frequency sorting.

## Process
1. Use (Anki-Connect)[https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect] to extract all sentences from your deck.
2. Use this list of words to generate a priority list using the (AnkiMorphs)[https://github.com/mortii/anki-morphs] addon in Anki.
3. Sort this priority list by frequency using the same method as (JP-resources)[https://github.com/MarvNC/JP-Resources/tree/main].
4. Enter this back into the (AnkiMorphs)[https://github.com/mortii/anki-morphs] addon in Anki.
